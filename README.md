# Cross Platform UI in Monogame

An example project using !(Puppeteer Sharp)[https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp] to achieve cross platform UI in !(Monogame)[https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame]. This allows websites to render on top of the game, so you could in theory make your game's UI in HTML/CSS/JS or whichever framework you use (really anything that works on the web). This is what we are currently trying to achieve in Contraband Software's planned Rock Engine.

Currently it can render everything correctly, but input event piping has not currently been implemented.
